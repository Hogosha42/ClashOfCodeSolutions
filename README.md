# Clash of Code Solutions

I wanted a place to save my solutions to Clash of Code and well, this is a pretty nice spot to do that.

## Folder Structure

for every problem there is a folder, in this folder there are the fastest solutions on the first layer and then in the shortest folder there is the shortest version. For example:

---

```
Clash of Code Solutions
│   README.md  
|
└───Adding_Lists
│   │   addinglists.py
│   │   addinglists.fs
│   │   ...
│   └───Shortest
│       │   shortaddinglists.py
│       │   shortaddinglists.fs
|       |   ...

```
